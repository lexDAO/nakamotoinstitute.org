                   A Cypherlawyer's Manifesto

Cypherlawyers write legal code.  We know that someone has to write legal code
to defend autonomy for our clients, and since we can't get autonomy unless we all do,
we're going to write it. We publish our legal code so that our fellow
Cypherlawyers may practice and play with it. Our legal code is free for all
to use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the
legal code we write.  We know that legal code can't be destroyed and that
a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. 

Cypherlawyers deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
fundamentally an autonomous act.  The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm.  Even laws against cryptography
reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
it the autonomous transactions systems that it makes possible. 

For autonomy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the common
good.  Autonomy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's
fellows in society.  We the Cypherlawyers seek your questions and your
legal concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
ourselves.  We will not, however, be moved out of our course because
some may disagree with our goals.

The Cypherlawyers are actively engaged in making the networks safer for
autonomous individuals.  Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.
